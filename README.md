# NikkiPythonProjects

I am working on 100 days of Python. Some of the projects I am working on during this time I have loaded to GitHub.
The point of 100 days of of Python is to familiarize myself with a scripting language.
My goal is learn about how Python Automation and Cybersecurity intersect.
I hope you enjoy my projects!
